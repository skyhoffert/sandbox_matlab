## Naming Conventions
Naming is a little confusing. I try to simplify things with these conventions. "Foo Bar" is the variable or phrase used to identify what the variable does.

* nFooBar : Number of Foo Bars
* fFooBar : Frequency of Foo Bar
* aFooBar : Amplitude of Foo Bar
* pFooBar : Power of Foo Bar

Other types will have a word to start the variable name. Ex:

* horsepowerFooBar : Horsepower for Foo Bar

#### Constants

There is no significant difference for constants (presently).

#### Arrays

Arrays will have a camel case name. Ex:

* audioSignal : 1D audio signal array.
